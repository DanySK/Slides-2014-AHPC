abstract = {The term computer simulation is related to the usage of a computational model in order to improve the understanding of a system's behavior and/or to evaluate strategies for its operation, in explanatory or predictive schemes. There are cases in which practical or ethical reasons make it impossible to realize direct observations: in these cases, the possibility of realizing 'in-machina' experiments may represent the only way to study, analyze and evaluate models of those realities. Different situations and systems are characterized by the presence of autonomous entities whose local behaviors (actions and interactions) determine the evolution of the overall system; agent-based models are particularly suited to support the definition of models of such systems, but also to support the design and implementation of simulators. Agent-Based models and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been adopted to simulate very different kinds of complex systems, from the simulation of socio-economic systems to the elaboration of scenarios for logistics optimization, from biological systems to urban planning. This paper discusses the specific aspects of this approach to modeling and simulation from the perspective of Informatics, describing the typical elements of an agent-based simulation model and the relevant research.},

    abstract = {Starts with a brief review of the history and the application
areas considered in the literature. The author then proceeds with
introductory modeling examples, behavioral and structural properties,
three methods of analysis, subclasses of Petri nets and their analysis.
In particular, one section is devoted to marked graphs, the concurrent
system model most amenable to analysis. Introductory discussions on
stochastic nets with their application to performance modeling, and on
high-level nets with their application to logic programming, are
provided. Also included are recent results on reachability criteria.
Suggestions are provided for further reading on many subject areas of
Petri nets},

@article{EwaldJOS2007,
    abstract = {With Systems Biology, a promising new application area for modeling and simulation emerges. Today's biologists are facing huge amounts of data delivered at different levels of detail by a multitude of advanced experimentation techniques. The Systems Biology approach copes with this information by cycling through phases of forming hypothesis, constructing models, experimenting with or analyzing these models, and validating the findings by wet-lab experiments. A crucial point is therefore the way in which the knowledge about a system is formalized, i.e., how a biological system is described as this constrains the perception of the system as well as scope of possible answers the model might provide. In this article, we compare different discrete-event modeling formalisms (Petri Nets, Stochastic Pi-Calculus , StateCharts, and Devs) regarding their applicability to a cell biological system of current research interest, the Wnt signaling pathway. We then introduce the popular Gillespie algorithm, which is the foundation of many discrete-event simulators for molecular-biological systems, and elaborate on some interesting extensions.},
